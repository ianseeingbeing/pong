# PONG
I made pong (with a few tweaks) using the [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) framework. Took me no more than 24 hours and I'm pleased with how it came out.
## Gameplay
This is a two player game where both sides have both vertical and horizontal movement. Simply hit the ball into the opponents side to score.
